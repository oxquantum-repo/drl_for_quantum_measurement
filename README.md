# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Measurement of Quantum Devices

Deep reinforcement learning is an emerging machine learning approach which can teach a computerto  learn  from  their  actions  and  rewards  similar  to  the  way  humans  learn  from  experience.   Itoffers many advantages in automating decision processes to navigate large parameter spaces.  Thispaper proposes a novel approach to the efficient measurement of quantum devices based on deepreinforcement learning.  We focus on double quantum dot devices, demonstrating the fully automaticidentification  of  specific  transport  features  called  bias  triangles.   Measurements  targeting  thesefeatures are difficult to automate, since bias triangles are found in otherwise featureless regions ofthe parameter space.  Our algorithm identifies bias triangles in a mean time of less than 30 minutes,and sometimes as little as 1 minute.  This approach, based on dueling deep Q-networks, can beadapted to a broad range of devices and target transport features.  This is a crucial demonstration ofthe utility of deep reinforcement learning for decision making in the measurement and operation ofquantum devices.
